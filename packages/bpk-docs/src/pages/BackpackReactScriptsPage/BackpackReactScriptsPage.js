      <Paragraph>
        Modern front-end development can be quite daunting. Getting started with
        React, es2015, Babel, Webpack and friends is so complex that
        &quot;boilerplate&quot; projects have sprung up all over GitHub. The
        main problem with these boilerplate projects is that there are literally
        hundreds of them making it hard to know which one to pick. Additionally,
        once you have downloaded a boilerplate project, you&apos;ve just
        inadvertently inherited a whole bunch of front-end tooling technical
        debt. If updates are made to the boilerplate project in the future, how
        are you supposed to upgrade?

      <Paragraph>
        <Code>backpack-react-scripts</Code> is aimed at providing teams and
        codebases with a standardised way of building production web apps with
        Backpack + React at Skyscanner. When you create an app using{' '}
        <Code>
          create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=backpack-react-scripts
        </Code>, you&apos;ll notice that your project&apos;s{' '}
        <Code>package.json</Code> has a dependency on{' '}
        <Code>backpack-react-scripts</Code>. When we release new versions going
        forward (i.e. support for server-side rendering etc), all you need to do
        is bump the version number and run <Code>npm install</Code> to reap the
        rewards.
