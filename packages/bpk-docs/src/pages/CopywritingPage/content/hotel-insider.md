When we're choosing where to stay on holiday, it's not just the hotel that makes the difference, but the neighbourhood, too. Everyone has their own travel style; some love being in the thick of things, others just want to chill. Some want to see all the sights, others just want to check out the best bars. (Hey, no judgement here...).

We can help people choose the right place to stay by giving them as much useful info as we can. That includes what the neighbourhood and the area offers, but also the sort of hotels and prices you're likely to find there.

All those things are important if you're going to plan the perfect trip.

**Here are two different entries for San Francisco:**

*Hayes Valley will give you a taste of local life. This quiet residential area is all rows of brightly painted Victorians and cute, neighbourhood restaurants (serving San Francisco's signature, California-sourced seasonal cuisine of course). Market Street, the downtown public transport hub, is only a few blocks' walk, but the city's green parks and waterfront are harder to reach (you're probably best getting a cab). There are no major hotel chains, but there are a few bed and breakfasts in historic homes, at mid-range prices. Try The Parsonage [LINK] or Chateau Tivoli [LINK].*

*Union Square is tourist-central. This busy, high-rise part of downtown is where you'll find most of the city's hotels - everything from midrange chains like the Hilton [LINK], to budget boutiques like rock 'n' roll-themed Hotel Zeppelin [LINK], or luxury digs like the Four Seasons [LINK]. You can catch everything from bus tours to cable cars here, shop at designer stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, and choose between any number of rowdy restaurants and bars - though you won't be mixing with many locals.*
