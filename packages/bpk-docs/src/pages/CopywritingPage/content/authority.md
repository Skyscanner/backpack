As this guide will make clear, we really can't say anything useful about a place unless we've actually been there. Our content is only helpful if it features personalised tips, recommendations and insight from people with on-the-ground experience.

Sure, we can sort of figure out what a place looks like and where the hot restaurants are with a bit of internet research. But can we give the details that make the difference? Do we know which bars are worth the hype? Do we know if the hotel really is a short walk from the train station, or a long, dangerous hike through a dodgy neighbourhood?

We want to help people have the best trip ever. We can't do that with guesswork. Do we want to send someone to that dodgy neighbourhood, because the hotel website made it look nicer? No. We patted ourselves on the back already! We want to be heroes.

PS: Not to sound too much like teacher, but it's a good idea to check spellings. We could give someone the most amazing recommendation, but if we spell it wrong, that's what they'll remember, and it makes people trust us less.
