We've talked a lot about being useful, and that means not leaving people with too many questions. Below are some typical questions travellers will have about things. You won't always need to answer all of them - you probably don't want to write an essay, and no-one wants to read one! - but you should try to answer as many as are appropriate with whatever it is that you write.

## Hotels

* What budget are we talking? Is it a low-cost B&B or hostel, a boutique hotel or expensive resort?
* Location? (Far from the city centre, but peaceful and good access to public transport? In the city centre, so close to everything, but a bit noisy?)
* What is the style? (Colourful? Minimal? Retro? Modern? Etc)
* What are the facilities like? (Is there a pool, a nice restaurant?)
* What are the other guests typically like? (Families? Hipsters?)
