On some destination pages, we give **safety tips** for LGBTQ and solo female travellers.

This doesn't mean trying to scare anyone; but it doesn't mean glossing over anything, either.
The best way to be helpful here is to explain *why* there might be safety issues, and then offer some solutions.

We don't want to put anyone off having an amazing travel experience. But we do want to make sure they have the best experience possible.

Check out [this example](https://www.trip.skyscanner.com/blog/expert-take-solo-female-travel-in-bangladesh/).

Here are some reasons it works:
* The writer remains ***positive** about the country and its people.
* She shares **personal** and **interesting** stories about her time there.
* But she is **honest** about **specific** issues that affect women travellers.
* She then offers **practical** advice others can use.
