      <Paragraph>
        All components are available to consume as React components, exposed as
        modules on the npm registry. They encapsulate structure, style, and
        logic which means that achieving a consistent look and feel across
        Skyscanner products on web, iOS and Android is as straightforward as:
        installing a package, importing it in a view and using it in JSX. Please
        see the Text component for{' '}
        <BpkLink href={`${ROUTES.TEXT}`} blank>

        </BpkLink>{' '}
        as examples.
      </Paragraph>,
      <BpkBlockquote extraSpace>
        The recommended way to get started with Backpack on web is to use{' '}

        <br />
        <strong>Note:</strong> If you are looking to integrate Backpack
        components into an existing project, be aware that components are
        published uncompiled which means you&apos;ll need to accommodate for
        this in your webpack config.

    blurb: [
      <Paragraph>
        Backpack&apos;s bonds are primarily available as a library of Sass
        variables and mixins. Furthermore, most atom level components are also
        available as mixins. Again, the library is exposed as a module on the
        npm registry which can be installed like so:
      </Paragraph>,
      <CodeBlock>npm install bpk-mixins --save-dev</CodeBlock>,
      <Paragraph>
        The following example demonstrates how to import the module and consume
        the primary button mixin:
      </Paragraph>,
      <CodeBlock>
        {`@import '~bpk-mixins/index';

.my-button {
  @include bpk-button;
}`}

        and makes extensive use of{' '}

        <BpkLink href={sassLoaderUrl} blank>

        </BpkLink>, you can use{' '}
        <BpkLink href={nodeSassTildeImporterUrl}>

      <Paragraph>
        Sketch is the preferred tool of choice for designing with Backpack. Its
        plugin-based architecture makes it highly extensible and customisable.
        We make heavy use of the Autolayout plugin from Anima to ensure symbols
        can be resized with ease. You can download that below. As well as this
        we use Sketch libraries to keep everyone in sync. These are split by
        platform. You can also grab the latest versions of these below.
