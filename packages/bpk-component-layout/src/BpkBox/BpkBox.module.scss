// Base BpkBox class
// Only contains essential default styles (box-sizing)
// Actual styles are applied via utility classes (e.g., .bpk-padding-base, .bpk-bg-surfaceHighlight)
// Dynamic values use dedicated *-dynamic classes (e.g., .bpk-width-dynamic) defined in layoutMixins
// This ensures only actual used styles are included in the CSS bundle
// CSS Modules will add its own hash (e.g., .bpk-box_a1b2c3d4)
