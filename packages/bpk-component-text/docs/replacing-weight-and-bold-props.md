# Removing bold and weight properties

The `bold` (equivalent to `bold` weight) and `weight` properties of BpkText have been removed in Backpack v24.
Check the following table to see what textStyle you should be using after removing the `weight` or `bold` props based on the current combination of textStyle and weight that you are using. Some combinations will not exist as part of the new typography system. You can choose to use the style recommended by Backpack's designers or work with your squad's designer to choose a different style.
