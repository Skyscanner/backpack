**Breaking:**

- bpk-component-badge:
    - Updated badge component to use the new spacing grid. This component will now appear larger in height so should be checked this does not alter layout.

**Added:**

- bpk-component-datepicker
- bpk-component-scrollable-calendar
  - Export `CALENDAR_SELECTION_TYPE` so it can be imported from `bpk-component-datepicker` and `bpk-component-scrollable-calendar` instead of `bpk-component-calendar`
