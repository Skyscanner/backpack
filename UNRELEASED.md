**Breaking**
- `bpk-component-graphic-promotion` - Now accepts a style prop and no longer accepts an image prop, leaving it up to the consumer to populate the background-image through styling

**Fixed:**
  - bpk-component-calendar
  - bpk-component-datepicker
    - Fixed an issue when using Assistive Technologies, a user could not select a date.
