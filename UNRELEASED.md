**Added:**
 - `bpk-component-floating-notification` - `1.0.0`

- bpk-component-price
  - Price is a new component to ensure consistent display of pricing.

**Fixed:**

- `@skyscanner/backpack-web`
  - Added missing dependencies `@skyscanner/bpk-svgs`, `@react-google-maps/api`, `@popperjs/core`

- bpk-component-theme-toggle
  - Removed `Konami` library and logic, so not to require it for the single package. It was added as fun for the documentation site but no longer relevant now.
