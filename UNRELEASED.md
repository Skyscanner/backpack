# Unreleased

Added:
- bpk-mixins
  - Added `bpk-select--invalid` mixin.

Changed:
- bpk-component-select
  - Invalid `BpkSelect`s now have a red border and background to match the style of invalid `BpkInput`s.

**Note**: The API hasn't changed, it's only breaking because it's a major visual change.
