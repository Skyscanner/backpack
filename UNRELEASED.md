`@skyscanner/backpack-web`

**Breaking:**
- Removed `bpk-component-content-container`. As this component was originally created for use on the backpack-docs site it is being removed. This component also follows a pattern of using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` which is not a good practice.
  - Should you be using this component, please migrate to the `BpkText` and should you need to include bottom padding pass this as a custom `className` to apply. E.g.

    ```css
    /* myCssFile.scss */
    .myTextClass {
      padding-bottom: $bpk-spacing-md;
    }
    ```
    ```javascript
    // myJsFile.js
    
    import BpkText, { TEXT_STYLES } from '@skyscanner/backpack-web/bpk-component-text';

    <BpkText tagName="h1" textStyle={TEXT_STYLES.heading1} className='myTextClass'>
      Your content here
    </BpkText>
    ```
