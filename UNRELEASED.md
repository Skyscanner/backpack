- `@skyscanner/backpack-web`:

**Fixed:**

- `BpkCard`:
    - Make atomic cards accessible to keyboard users

- `BpkDataTable`:
    - Fixed warnings about props not being recognised.

**Changed:**
  - `BpkDividedCard`
    - Add prop `isElevated` to switch on/off the card shadow so that it wouldn't overlap with the shadow of the card wrapper.
