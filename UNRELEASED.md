# Unreleased

**Added:**

- bpk-component-popover:
  - Added `closeButtonProps` so that consumers can set props on the close button - for example, `tabIndex`.

**Fixed:**

 - react-native-bpk-component-navigation-bar:
   - Long titles are now truncated.
   - **Android** Fixed a bug where the navigation bar would change the status bar colour and style without changing it back when being unmounted.
