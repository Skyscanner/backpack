### Decisions

Conventions and squad decisions are kept in the [decisions folder](/decisions). We recommend familiarising yourself with these.

### Installing Node

Backpack is developed using Node, using the following versions:

* `LTS/Carbon` (Node ^8.12.0)
* `^6.4.1` (npm)

This is enforced using a pre-install hook that calls out to [ensure-node-env](https://github.com/Skyscanner/ensure-node-env).

If you use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [nave](https://github.com/isaacs/nave) to manage your Node environment, Backpack has built-in support for these. Just run `nvm use` or `nave auto` to install the correct Node version.

To install npm, use `npm install --global npm@^6.4.1`.


### Android, iOS and React Native

Backpack also supports React Native, plus native Android and iOS.

They can be found at [backpack-android](https://github.com/skyscanner/backpack-android) and [backpack-ios](https://github.com/skyscanner/backpack-ios) and [backpack-react-native](https://github.com/skyscanner/backpack-react-native)

### Code style

Backpack uses a combination of [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to enforce coding styles. ESLint runs as a pre-commit hook, so it isn't possible to commit code that causes ESLint to fail.

We recommend that you install [a plugin to your editor](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors) to run ESLint automatically, which will then show you any errors inline. You can even enable an option to fix ESLint errors automatically upon saving.

## Getting started

### Getting the code

You should pull code down using the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Backpack.git
```

### Install dependencies

Run `npm install` to install dependencies from npm.

<details>
<summary>A note on dependencies</summary>

Backpack is a multi-package repository, also known as a monorepo. This means that instead of having one code repository for each npm package, we manage them all inside this single repository.

We use [Lerna](https://lernajs.io) to achieve this. Lerna links packages together inside this repo by 'bootstrapping'.

When you run `npm install`, Lerna is bootstrapped automatically as a post-install hook. However, if you change dependencies within a package, you will need to run Lerna manually with `npm run bootstrap`.

</details>

### Build the code

Backpack's code depends on some things that must be built first, such as icon fonts, SVGs and tokens.

Use `npm run build` to do this.

### Run the development environment

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for our development environment.

#### Web

Run `npm start` to start the storybook server, then go to [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) in a web browser to view it.

## Adding icons

If you want to add icons, they should first be approved by [Chris](https://skyscanner.slack.com/messages/D6BU4R0V8) as he "owns" Skyscanner icons.

Once they're signed off, you can [raise a request](https://bit.ly/backpack-request) and attach the SVG files. If you're feeling heroic and want to make the PR yourself, just copy the correctly named SVG files to `./packages/bpk-svgs/src/icons/` and then run `npm run build`.

## Adding a new component

If you want to add a new component, we will need the following:

- Design (Sketch file)
- Associated tokens
- Sass mixin(s)
- React component
- Stories
- Tests
- Documentation (Including main `README.md`)

### Design

Sketch is the preferred format for non-technical folks. We’d appreciate if you could provide an exact match of your component in Sketch format together with folders for each state e.g. disabled, expanded etc.

### Tokens

Any visual CSS parameters of the component, such as *color, margins, paddings* etc. should not live as magic numbers in the component code, but as **tokens** in the `bpk-tokens` package.

Tokens are defined in the `src/base` directory (with the exception of product-specific tokens, which are in other subdirectories). Tokens come in two layers: In `aliases.json`, all base tokens are defined with concrete values, such as colours, numbers and sizes. The other files then map those aliases to tokens for specific elements.

> You should probably not touch `aliases.json`, as our color palette or grid rarely changes.

### Sass mixins

All Sass mixins are defined in the `bpk-mixins` package. The package also exposes the Sass variables from the `bpk-tokens` package.

If you add a new file of mixins, for example for a new *atom*, make sure you add the file to the imports in `_index.scss`.

### React component

Use `npm run create-component` to create a new skeleton React component. Once this is created, use existing components for code style inspiration.

We use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) along with [BEM](http://getbem.com/) to prevent collisions and accidental overwrites in CSS.

### Documentation

Our documentation consists of two parts: [Sassdoc](https://backpack.github.io/sassdoc/), which is automatically generated from the `bpk-mixin` sources, and the main [documentation](https://backpack.github.io).

#### Sassdoc

As mentioned, the Sassdoc are automatically generated from source and comments. If you want to double check, you can generate them using `npm run sassdoc` and start a static server to browse the docs, but usually this is not necessary.

Take a look at some of the mixin source files to see how to annotate your Sass to generate proper Sassdoc.

#### Backpack documentation

For documentation changes, please see our [Backpack docs repo](http://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack-docs).

## How to

<details>
<summary>Create a pull request to Backpack</summary>

For anything non-trivial, we strongly recommend speaking to somebody from Backpack squad before starting work on a PR. This lets us pass on any advice or knowledge we already have about the work you're proposing. It might even be something we're already working on. After this, follow the steps below.

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack/fork).
2. Create a new branch.
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit and push your new branch.
5. Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack/pulls).
6. Notify someone in Backpack squad or drop a note in #backpack.

Don't forget to update [`UNRELEASED.yaml`](UNRELEASED.yaml) for any user-facing changes.

Bear in mind that small, incremental pull requests are likely to be reviewed faster.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Run tests</summary>

`npm test` will pick up any files that end in `-test.js`, so you don't need to do anything to make Jest pick them up.

You can also run the tests in 'watch mode', which means the process will continually run and run tests every time files change. Use `npm run jest:watch` to do this.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Run linters manually</summary>

* `npm run lint` to lint both JS and SCSS.
* `npm run lint:js` to lint JS.
* `npm run lint:js:fix` to lint and try to automatically fix any errors.
* `npm run lint:scss` to lint SCSS.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Publish packages (Backpack squad members only)</summary>

- Update the [unreleased changelog](/unreleased.yaml) with every package that has changed, separating out `BRAKING`, `ADDED` and `FIXED` changes (there are examples at the bottom of the file). If you need more details on classification please checkout the [versioning decision](/decisions/versioning-rules.md)).
  - Some useful commands for determining "what's changed?":
    - `npm run lerna updated`
    - `npm run lerna diff <package-name>`
- Make sure you are an owner of the npm packages (speak to a member of the Backpack squad).
- **Run `npm run release`** (this will run several checks and then `lerna publish`). Do not run `npm publish`.
- You’ll be asked to confirm the new versions and descriptions for every package that has changed.
- If you need to make changes you can exit without confirming and no changes will be made.

Be aware that if `bpk-tokens` has changed, *all* packages in the repository will be updated as they all depend on `bpk-tokens`. Changing an existing token is almost always worth a "major" release, whereas adding a new token is usually a "minor" release.

When a component is released for the first time on npm, remember to add the component to the Skyscanner organisation through the [npm UI](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/skyscanner/teams/team/backpack/access).
