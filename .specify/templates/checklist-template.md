# [CHECKLIST TYPE] Checklist: [COMPONENT NAME]

**Purpose**: [Brief description of what this checklist covers]
**Created**: [DATE]
**Component**: [Link to spec.md or relevant documentation]

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on component context and requirements.

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The checklist items below are SAMPLE ITEMS for illustration only.

  The /speckit.checklist command MUST replace these with actual items based on:
  - User's specific checklist request
  - Component requirements from spec.md
  - Technical context from plan.md
  - Implementation details from tasks.md
  - Backpack constitution principles from .specify/memory/constitution.md
  - Architecture decisions from decisions/ directory

  Checklist items MUST be "Unit Tests for Requirements" - validating that
  requirements are complete, clear, consistent, and measurable - NOT testing
  if the implementation works correctly.

  DO NOT keep these sample items in the generated checklist file.
