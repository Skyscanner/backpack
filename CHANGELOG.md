## 2017-08-03 - Deprecated Heading & Paragraph components

**Changed:**

- bpk-component-heading:
- bpk-component-paragraph:

  - These components are now deprecated, please use `bpk-component-text` instead:

    **bpk-component-heading -> bpk-component-text:**

    If you were relying on the baked-in bottom margin:

    ```
    // old
    <BpkHeading level="h1">My Heading</BpkHeading>

    // new
    <BpkText tagName="h1" textStyle="xxl" className="MyHeading">
      My Heading
    </BpkText>

    .MyHeading {
      margin-bottom: $bpk-spacing-sm;
    }
    ```

    If you were opting out of the baked-in bottom margin:

    ```
    // old
    <BpkHeading level="h1" bottomMargin={false}>My Heading</BpkHeading>

    // new
    <BpkText tagName="h1" textStyle="xxl">My Heading</BpkText>
    ```

    **bpk-component-paragrapg -> bpk-component-text:**

    ```
    // old
    <BpkParagraph>My paragraph.</BpkParagraph>

    // new
    <BpkText tagName="p" textStyle="base" className="MyParagraph">
      My paragraph.
    </BpkText>

    .MyParagraph {
    margin-bottom: $bpk-spacing-sm;
    }
    ```

## 2017-08-03 - Additional "BEM" text mixins plus :bug: fixes

**Added:**

- bpk-mixins: 16.0.0 => 16.1.0

  - Added BEM `bpk-text--XX` mixins for text styles. These are similar but subtly different to existing
    `bpk-text-XX` mixins
  - By default, use the BEM-style mixins:

    ```scss
    .my-component {
      @include bpk-text; // resets margin
      @include bpk-text--sm; // applies sm text style
    }
    ```

  - If you want the text style but need to apply custom margin, use the `bpk-text-xx` stand-alone mixins:

    ```scss
    .my-component {
      margin: $bpk-spacing-sm 0 $bpk-spacing-base 0; // applies custom margin

      @include bpk-text-sm; // applies sm text style
    }
    ```

- bpk-react-utils: 2.1.1 => 2.2.0
  - Added `withDefaultProp` HOC to simplify using the same component with the same props in many places.

**Fixed:**

- bpk-component-table: 1.0.2 => 1.0.3

  - `BpkTableCell`'s now accept arbitrary props and classNames

- bpk-component-icon: 3.9.2 => 3.9.3

  - `withAlignment` HOC uses wrapping `span` to prevent overriding the style of an aligned component

- bpk-component-breakpoint: 1.0.2 => 1.0.3
  - Unpinned `react-responsive` to `^1.3.2` as the breaking change released in `1.3.2` has been resolved

## 2017-07-28 - New Text component and mixins

**Breaking:**

- bpk-mixins: 15.7.1 => 16.0.0

  - Text mixins (`bpk-text-base`, `bpk-text-lg` etc.) now set letter-spacing and font-weight explicitly. This means you
    cannot set `font-weight` any more before including the mixin. Instead, use the new `bpk-text-bold` mixin to embolden
    text:

    ```scss
    .selector {
      @include bpk-text-lg;
      @include bpk-text-bold;
    }
    ```

- bpk-tokens: 23.3.1 => 24.0.0

  - Aliases in `.raw.json` format are now objects with a `value` property i.e.

    ```json
    "WHITE": {
      "value": "#ffffff"
    },
    ```

    ...instead of...

    ```json
    "WHITE": "#ffffff",
    ```

**Added:**

- bpk-mixins: 15.7.1 => 16.0.0

  - New `bpk-text-xs` mixin in addition to the existing text styles (`sm`, `base`, `lg`, `xl`, `xxl`)

- bpk-tokens: 23.3.1 => 24.0.0

  - New theme for iOS, with specific text styles and spacings
  - Text style tokens for the base theme, in line with the new iOS theme

- bpk-component-text: 1.0.0
  - **New component** `BpkText` is the new preferred method for rendering text of all kinds. It utilizes the newly added
    mixins and allows separation of text style and semantics.

**Fixed:**

- bpk-tokens: 23.3.1 => 24.0.0
  - Android colours are now #AARRGGBB instead of #RRGGBBAA

## 2017-07-24 - Icon improvements and fixes
