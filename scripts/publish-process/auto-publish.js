/*
 * How this works
 *
 * First of all, this scans all our packages and gets the current versions.
 * It then looks to see which packages have changed and therefore need releasing.
 *
 * It parses UNRELEASED.yaml to find out the semver change of each package for release.
 * If a changed package is not shown in UNRELEASED.yaml it will assume `patch`.
 *
 * It will then summarise all publishable changes for you, and ask you to confirm.
 * Once you confirm, it will update every package.json, update CHANGELOG.md, reset UNRELEASED.yaml, and push everything to git.
 *
 * Each package will then be published to NPM, and the "Publish" commit
 *
 * Finally, it will generate a message for you to copy-paste to #backpack to inform consumers of published changes.
