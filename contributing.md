## Before you jump in

Is there something that you think should be in Backpack, but currently isn't? Before you dive in, please note that not everything that is a UI component belongs in Backpack.

> Is this really going to be used by multiple products?

If you use it multiple times yourself, it might as well be a component, but maybe Backpack is the wrong place for it and it should instead stay in your own codebase. If in doubt, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us!

> I’m sure this should be in Backpack!

Awesome! The rest of this file should give you a good picture of the process.

Backpack development takes places on Github. If you don't have a Github account, you can create one
on [github.com](https://github.com).

When you are ready to jump into code, use the following workflow to add new components or change any existing ones:

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack)
2. Create a new branch
3. Make your changes
4. Commit and push your new branch
5. Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack/pulls)
6. Notify someone in the Backpack Design System squad or drop a note in #backpack

## Getting started

> Backpack development requires Node LTS and npm `^5.6.0`. [Nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) users can run
`nvm use` to switch to `lts/carbon`. [Nave](https://github.com/isaacs/nave) users can use `nave auto`. You can also
download Node LTS using [their website](https://nodejs.org/en/). To install npm `^5.6.0`,
run `npm install --global npm@^5.6.0`. Backpack uses prettier via ESLint to format code, you should set up your editor to run eslint fix on save or if you don't whish to do that run `npm run prettier` before committing.
A pre-commit hook exists to verify code style and will fail if prettier is not being used.

To get started run:

```sh
npm install
```

The Backpack repository is a **multi-package repository**. This means that, instead of having one code repository for each npm module, we manage all of Backpack’s npm modules in a single code repository.

The tool we use for managing this multi-repo is [Lerna](https://lernajs.io).

> Because we use Lerna to manage multiple packages in one repository,
> you'll also need to run `npm run bootstrap` anytime that you have changed the dependencies
> within a package. This is the equivalent to running `npm install` inside each of the package
> folders.

You can find the individual modules / packages inside the `packages/` folder.

## Development tasks

```sh
ENABLE_CSS_MODULES=true npm start # Start development test harness complete with hot module reloading [HMR]
npm test                          # Lints .js & .scss files and runs unit tests
npm run build                     # Runs the build process for all packages
```

## Decisions

See the [decisions directory](/decisions) for an organised list of cultural and code decisions
made concerning this monorepo.

## Adding a new component

If you want to add a new component, we will need the following:

- Design (Sketch file)
- Associated tokens
- Sass mixin(s)
- React component
- Stories
- Tests
- Documentation (Including main `readme.md`)


### Design

Sketch is the preferred format for non-technical folks. We’d appreciate if you could provide an exact match of your component in Sketch format together with folders for each state e.g. disabled, expanded etc.

### Tokens

Any visual CSS parameters of the component, such as *color, margins, paddings* etc. should not live as magic numbers in the component code, but as **tokens** in the `bpk-tokens` package.

Tokens are defined in the `src/base` directory (with the exception of product-specific tokens, which are in other subdirectories). Tokens come in two layers: In `aliases.json`, all base tokens are defined with concrete values, such as colors, numbers and sizes. The other files then map those aliases to tokens for specific elements.

> You should probably not touch `aliases.json`, as our color palette or grid rarely changes.

Be aware that changing tokens will update *all* packages in the repository, as they all depend on `bpk-tokens`. Changing an existing token is almost always worth a "major" release, whereas adding a new token is usually a "minor" release.

#### Building

To build the tokens, run

```sh
npm run build:tokens
```

This will output different formats from the source JSON, for example Sass variables, a JavaScript module, Android and iOS resources.

### Sass mixins

All Sass mixins are defined in the `bpk-mixins` package. The package also exposes the Sass variables from the `bpk-tokens` package.

If you add a new file of mixins, for example for a new *atom*, make sure you add the file to the imports in `_index.scss`.

#### Linting

To lint the Sass, run

```sh
npm run lint:scss
```

### React component

Each React component has its own subdirectory `packages/bpk-component-<component-name>`, where the npm module is stored. For it to be properly published, create a `package.json` starting at version `0.0.0` and take inspiration from existing packages in terms of structure. We use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) along with [BEM](http://getbem.com/) to prevent collisions and accidental overwrites in CSS.

#### Storybook

We use [Storybook](https://getstorybook.io/) to drive the development of Backpack's UI components. Start it using `npm start`.

Create a `stories.js` file and use it to list all the different possible states of your component. Check out Storybook's documentation for more details, and also check out the `stories.js` files of existing components.

> Make sure you import your new component's stories into Storybook by adding it to `.storybook/config.js`.

#### Testing

React components need to be properly unit tested. We use [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)'s snapshot testing, but depending on the complexity of your component, you may want to add additional tests.

#### README

Create a `readme.md` file that shows how to install and use your component. It should also include a table of the component's props, PropTypes and their default values. Take inspiration from existing components.

### Documentation

Our documentation consists of two parts: [Sassdoc](https://backpack.github.io/sassdoc/), which is automatically generated from the `bpk-mixin` sources, and the main [documentation](https://backpack.github.io).

#### Sassdoc

As mentioned, the Sassdoc are automatically generated from source and comments. If you want to double check, you can generate them using `npm run sassdoc` and start a static server to browse the docs, but usually this is not necessary.

Take a look at some of the mixin source files to see how to annotate your Sass to generate proper Sassdoc.

#### Backpack documentation

The Backpack documentation is a standalone client-side app. Each package has its own “page”, which you can find and edit in the `bpk-docs` package under `src/pages`.

The “page” modules themselves contain introductory blurbs and examples for the respective component. They also import the component’s README, which you should have created according to the section further up in this document.

You can run the docs app locally using:

```sh
npm run build
npm run docs
```

And loading [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

If you need any help writing documentation, get in touch!

When adding documentation for a new component:
 * add the new dependency in `packages/bpk-docs/package.json` and run `npm run bootstrap` to install it.
 * add routes for your new component in `packages/bpk-docs/src/constants/Routes.js` and `packages/bpk-docs/src/constants/redirect-routes.js`
 * add new link in `packages/bpk-docs/src/layouts/links.js`

The web Map component page requires an environment variable named `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`. During builds, this is set by Travis.

## React Native

Backpack comes in two flavours: web and React Native. React Native (RN) components
live inside `/native/packages`. The root of `/native` contains things to assist
with running and testing RN components locally.

### Prerequisites

Before running RN components locally, you'll need a few things in place.

#### iOS

##### XCode

Available from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Once installed,
open it and accept the licence agreement. You're free to close it after that.

##### Ruby via rbenv or rvm

We use Ruby to manage CocoaPods and recommend you use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to get the correct Ruby version. The ruby version is specified in `native/ios/.ruby-version`. With the correct ruby version and bundler installed run `bundler install` followed by `bundle exec pod install` inside `native/ios`.

#### Android

The following instructions heavily make use of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/),
which is available for macOS. Windows and Linux installation for these packages is also well-supported, but isn't currently documented here.

In future, we intend to automate more of this to reduce the number of steps required. To ensure that maps powered by Google work set the `google_maps_api_key` in `native/android/local.properties` and make sure you are using the backpack.keystore.

##### APK signing

For members of Backpack we have a keystore tied to our Google Maps API key in LastPass. Retrieve this key and place it in `native/android/backpack.keystore`. For contributors who are not members of Backpack nothing needs to be done, but Google Maps will not work. If you need Google Maps to work you'll need to supply your own Google Maps Api Key and possible keystore.

##### Watchman (if not already installed)

```
brew install watchman
```

## Java 8
Java 8 is required. Other versions may not work!

```
brew tap caskroom/versions
brew cask install java8
```

##### Android Studio and SDK

```
brew cask install android-studio
```

Open it once installed, and a setup wizard will guide you through installing lots of extra things like the Android SDK (choose *Standard* installation). You may be asked for your password during this. Once that's done, you're free to close Android Studio.

Add an environment variable pointing to the SDK location to your `~/.bash_profile`
(or similarly used file):

```
echo "export ANDROID_HOME=\"$HOME/Library/Android/sdk\"" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo "export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=\"$HOME/Library/Android/sdk\"" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Accept the SDK licences:

```
$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
```

Download Android system images for the minimum and targeted API levels. Note that you may get a warning about a `.cfg` file not being present. You're safe to ignore this.

```
$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/tools/bin/sdkmanager "system-images;android-27;google_apis;x86"
$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/tools/bin/sdkmanager "system-images;android-21;google_apis;x86"
```
Create Android Virtual Devices (AVDs):

```
$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/tools/bin/avdmanager create avd --name "bpk-avd" --package "system-images;android-27;google_apis;x86" --device "pixel" && cp native/android/bpk-avd.ini ~/.android/avd/bpk-avd.avd/config.ini
$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/tools/bin/avdmanager create avd --name "bpk-avd-min" --package "system-images;android-21;google_apis;x86" --device "Nexus 5"
```

You should now have a functioning Android development environment, including
virtual devices to run things on. You can run the AVD manually with `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/emulator/emulator -avd bpk-avd`,
but `npm run android` will handle this for you, so it's not required.

To test on the minimum supported API level , run the `bpk-avd-min` with `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/emulator/emulator -avd bpk-avd-min`. Make sure each component is rendered correctly and functions properly on all versions above `minSdkVersion` of Android.

### Storybook

Just like with the web, [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/app/react-native) is used to test RN components. Start it with `npm run native`.

Once Storybook is running, use `npm run ios` or `npm run android` to run storybook
on a device.

## Publishing packages (Backpack squad members only)

- Update the [unreleased changelog](/unreleased.md) with every package that has changed, separating out breaking changes (*major*), additions (*minor*) and fixes (*patch*) changes (you should see examples of this in previous entries of the [changelog](/changelog.md)).
  - Some useful commands for determining "what's changed?":
    - `npm run lerna updated`
    - `npm run lerna diff <package-name>`
- Make sure you are an owner of the npm packages (speak to a member of the Backpack squad)
- **Do not run `npm publish`. Instead, run `npm run publish`** (this will run `lerna publish`).
- You’ll be asked to specify a new version for every package that has changed. Options are *patch*, *minor* or *major*. These should directly align to the entries you put in the [unreleased changelog](/unreleased.md) in step 1.
- You’ll be asked at the end to confirm. Note you can still exit without making these changes.
- Move entries from [unreleased.md](/unreleased.md) to the [changelog](/changelog.md). Update the package versions for the new changes, and group them under a title with today’s date and a brief summary of what has changed.
- Commit and push to master.

## Publishing new components
Whenever a new component is added make sure the version is 0.0.1 until it gets published.

When a component is released for the first time on NPM remember to add the component to the Skyscanner org through the [NPM UI](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/skyscanner/teams/team/backpack/access), be careful to add only Backpack components to the organisation.
