            \`aria-relevant\` determines what sort of changes should be read out. By default it is \`text\` but can be \`additions\`, \`removals\` or \`all\`. [Read more about \`aria-relevant\` on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-relevant).
            \`aria-atomic\` is a boolean which determines whether changes should be read out, or the whole region should be read out. [Read more about \`aria-atomic\` on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions#Use_Case:_Clock).
