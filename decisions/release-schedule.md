The first column of the table above indicates the period during which a major change might be introduced into the code in a backwards-compatible way before being released in a major version.
However, this period may vary depending on the complexity of the change, and a change might be introduced *before* the specified period, allowing consumers a longer adoption period.

## FAQ

### What about minor and patch releases?

Minor and patch versions are released throughout the year whenever requested by consumers.

### I want to contribute a breaking change to a backpack component. What should I do?

Major changes **MUST** always be introduced in a backwards-compatible manner using [future](future-api.md) or a [deprecated](deprecated-api.md) flags. These changes **MUST** only be released as part of a major release during the designated time for major releases.

### I want to contribute a breaking change to a backpack component  and start using it immediately. What should I do?

You can use [future flags](future-api.md) to contribute your change and adopt it without waiting for the next major release.

### When will these changes become the default?

There **MUST** be a minimum of 3 months between the introduction of a change under a `future` or `deprecated` flag and its release in a major version.
